# GGGAN
 Official pytorch implementation of paper [Synthesis of Mammogram From Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network With Gradient Guided cGANs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9398655). <br><br>
 This code was implemented in 2018 with pytorch 0.4, which is too old.
